-\chapter{Chapter 1: The Hard Worker}
 There was a man who was reknown for both his hard work and his passion for what he did.  

He grew up in Central America, his father working as a Civil Engineer; building dams, bridges, and following the work created by the industrialization of the South Americas.  From evading bus robbers in the rural parts of Columbia to learning a new language in a foreign country, to dropping water ballons on cars from the window of his family's apartment, his childhood was filled with happy memories which grew him into a man who loved pursuing challenges and solving problems.

His name was Ethan, and he graduated high school in Boston, then attended college on a scholarship from the Air Force, later dropping out of the Air Force Academy.

Graduating from Cal Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering, he created a company which was similar to Yelp, but long before Yelp, or even the internet was considered part of life in the average household.  

The site allowed small resturants to make themselves more discoverable on a public domain, which offered a revolutionary new market.  Unfortunately, the company was, in many ways, ahead of its time, and no resturaunt owners saw need or demand for a means of marketing themselves on a niche technology. 

After roughly two million dollars of investment into the start-up between six people, the company went under and was declared bankrupt.  Several months of toil, anxiety, meetings with investors, and personal savings were poured out, with nothing to show for.

However, lessons were learned, the six friends parted ways on good terms, and Ethan re-entered the workforce, working towards a Ph.D at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and taking a job as a lecturer at HKUst.

From the failed start-up, he learned how to allocate and assign resources more efficiently, decided to hire based sole-ly on merit, and in his work, kept his eyes open for the next technology that the world was in need of.


\chapter{Chapter 2: A New Start}

Ethan knew he was a hardworking and creative man, and he refused to let his failed startup ruin his dreams of creating something great. 

As an assistant lecturer for an information systems class, he interacted with students often, especially during office hours, and through these conversations he often heard tidbits of their busy and exciting lives. One thing he noticed was that the students in his class were very ambitious and career-oriented. So Ethan, being the creator/innovator he was, thought about creating an application that could benefit his students. 

Over the next few months, he brainstormed and developed ideas for a site that would allow users to easily search and apply for jobs. (In our decade, his idea could be compared to LinkedIn.) Ethan saw it as a platform for college students to put themselves out there, a way to showcase their skills, projects, and achievements. 

Ethan had a new idea, and he was ready for the world to see it.
