\section{The Man Comes Around}
And I heard as it were, the noise of thunder.  One of the four beasts saying: come and see!
 
And I saw! 
 
And behold, a white horse.
 
\chapter{Chapter 1: The Hard Worker}
There was a man who was reknown for both his hard work and his passion for what he did.  

He grew up in Central America, his father working as a Civil Engineer; building dams, bridges, and following the work created by the industrialization of the South Americas.  From evading bus robbers in the rural parts of Columbia to learning a new language in a foreign country, to dropping water ballons on cars from the window of his family's apartment, his childhood was filled with happy memories which grew him into a man who loved pursuing challenges and solving problems.

His name was Ethan, and he graduated high school in Boston, then attended college on a scholarship from the Air Force, later dropping out of the Air Force Academy.

Graduating from Cal Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering, he created a company which was similar to Yelp, but long before Yelp, or even the internet was considered part of life in the average household.  

The site allowed small resturants to make themselves more discoverable on a public domain, which offered a revolutionary new market.  Unfortunately, the company was, in many ways, ahead of its time, and no resturaunt owners saw need or demand for a means of marketing themselves on a niche technology. 

After roughly two million dollars of investment into the start-up between six people, the company went under and was declared bankrupt.  Several months of toil, anxiety, meetings with investors, and personal savings were poured out, with nothing to show for.

However, lessons were learned, the six friends parted ways on good terms, and Ethan re-entered the workforce, working towards a Ph.D at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and taking a job as a lecturer at HKUst.

From the failed start-up, he learned how to allocate and assign resources more efficiently, decided to hire based sole-ly on merit, and in his work, kept his eyes open for the next technology that the world was in need of.


\chapter{Chapter 2: A New Start}
Ethan knew he was a hardworking and creative man, and he refused to let his failed startup ruin his dreams of creating something great. 

As an assistant lecturer for an information systems class, he interacted with students often, especially during office hours, and through these conversations he often heard tidbits of their busy and exciting lives. One thing he noticed was that the students in his class were very ambitious and career-oriented. So Ethan, being the creator/innovator he was, thought about creating an application that could benefit his students. 

Over the next few months, he brainstormed and developed ideas for a site that would allow users to easily search and apply for jobs. (In our decade, his idea could be compared to LinkedIn.) Ethan saw it as a platform for college students to put themselves out there, a way to showcase their skills, projects, and achievements. 

Ethan had a new idea, and he was ready for the world to see it. 


\chapter{Chapter 3: A Lost Treasure}
Right as Ethan began designing his new site, he was shocked to learn that an implementation of his idea already existed. He felt no reason to continue with it.

But there was light at the end of the tunnel. One day, during office hours, he found himself passionately discussing a retro video game with one of his students. The student was in a game development class, and Ethan himself was an avid gamer, from his childhood years to his last month of undergrad. And then he wondered: what if I’ve been looking for ideas in the wrong place this whole time? 

To everyone’s surprise, Ethan left his job as a lecturer to open his own indie game company, with the help of that student. It took over three years to release their first product: a dungeon crawler. Although it wasn’t a huge success, it was enough to get his company’s name out there. Having learned much from that experience, Ethan became a more knowledgeable player in the field.

Ethan came up with a brilliant twist on an old genre. He conceived of an idea similar to Pokemon but with a greater emphasis on 3-D perspective. It wasn’t a Pokemon clone, but it had classic gameplay elements with a turn-based system that reminded people of Pokemon while staying fresh and original.

Ethan couldn’t wait to see its release.
