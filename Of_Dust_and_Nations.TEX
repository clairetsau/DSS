\chapter{Chapter 2: A New Start}

Ethan knew he was a hardworking and creative man, and he refused to let his failed startup ruin his dreams of creating something great. 

As an assistant lecturer for an information systems class, he interacted with students often, especially during office hours, and through these conversations he often heard tidbits of their busy and exciting lives. One thing he noticed was that the students in his class were very ambitious and career-oriented. So Ethan, being the creator/innovator he was, thought about creating an application that could benefit his students. 

Over the next few months, he brainstormed and developed ideas for a site that would allow users to easily search and apply for jobs. (In our decade, his idea could be compared to LinkedIn.) Ethan saw it as a platform for college students to put themselves out there, a way to showcase their skills, projects, and achievements. 

Ethan had a new idea, and he was ready for the world to see it.
