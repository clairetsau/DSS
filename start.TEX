\section{The Man Comes Around}
And I heard as it were, the noise of thunder.  One of the four beasts saying: come and see!

And I saw!

\chapter{Chapter 1: The Hard Worker}
There was a college student named Ethan, and he was reknown for both his hard work and his passion for what he did.  Graduating from Cal Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering, he created a company which was similar to Yelp, but long before Yelp, or even the internet was considered part of life in the average household.  

The site allowed small resturants to make themselves more discoverable on a public domain, which offered a revolutionary new market.  Unfortunately, the company was, in many ways, ahead of its time, and no resturaunt owners saw need or demand for a means of marketing themselves on a niche technology. 

After roughly two million dollars of investment into the start-up between six people, the company went under and was declared bankrupt.  


However, lessons were learned, friends parted ways on good terms, and Ethan re-entered the workforce, working towards a Ph.D at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and taking a job as a lecturer at HKUst.
